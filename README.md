This is a collection of some of the better fractal flame images I've made.

I started making them back in 2013 using Apophysis7x.

These two fractals are some of the earliest fractals I made in Apophysis.

More recently, I've gotten back into making fractals using Fractorium. With OpenCL support, it's many times faster and easier to use. In practice this means privews take about a tenth of a second instead of 5-10 seconds to fully draw and rendering a full image now takes about a minute instead of 10-60 minutes.

Most of my images were originally rendered at 1920x1200 because that was the resolution of my old monitors. Most have been re-rendered at 1440p and I would like to eventually re-render everything at 4k. Due to software limitations, there is some manual work required to reframe the images when doing a render at a different resolution.

Here's an example of how I create these fractals by making small changes, occasionally randering them out as images to see in high detail how the results look and continue the process until I get something I like or the image becomes jacked up and I have to revert to an earlier version. Early versions of this ripple photo had somewhat muddy color and weren't as dynamic as I would prefer. I ended up zooming out to capture more rings, switched to a brighter palette and changed the fractal to spread out more and be less uniform.

These two fractals appear pretty different but they're actually both derived from a common starting point and use the exact same functions/variations and weights, just the locations/transforms, palette and the camera position in 3d space are different.

#### Phone wallpapers

Cellphone resolutions vary wildly across models/brands so I've just chucked whatever I've rendered for my personal use.
